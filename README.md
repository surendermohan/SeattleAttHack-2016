# Our Product: Walmart Price Exploiter
Authors: Surender Mohan, KS Madaan, Matthew Calligaro, Tenzin Khando and Nikhil Grover

# What does it do?
The Walmart Price Exploiter saves you money on any product you buy online 
at Walmart.com by comparing prices of the products you buy to a variety
of competitors, sending you a notification to take advantage of 
Walmart's Price Guarantee Policy if a lower price is found.

# How does it work?
All you have to do is give the app authentication into your email, and 
the rest is done on our end. We will check your email for any products
that you have bought from Walmart and automatically find the same product
at a lower price somewhere else.

# Getting Started
Make sure you move 'client_secret.json' into the Debug folder
